this is a part of the complete web application that i made with my friend , i helped him in creating recommendations for the user. the question post controller contains Graph Queries that were implemented via Neo4j. Moreover Javascript driver is used to incoperate GraphQL into express application. 
the recommendation are suggested to user on two basis 1- collabroative filtering using cosine similarity 2- content based filtering
this also incoperates community algorithm based on louvian graph algorithm

but this does not handles users real time interacrtions and due to time and knowledge constraints I didn't deal with meta data but recommendations are made based on user interests and skills he has.
